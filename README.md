A very basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game between _Computer and User_ without __utilizing any framework__. In this game, the computer generates a random choice and the user selects their option (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). The outcome is then determined, indicating whether the user wins, loses or the game ends in a draw.
